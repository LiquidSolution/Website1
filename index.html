                    <p>Fusion is energy's boy who cried wolf. It's been just around the corner for so long that people can't believe it's just around the corner now.</p>
                    <p>“As a physicist, we always joke that fusion has been 50 years away for 50 years,” said Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley. “But in the last four or five years, with the effort that's going on here, the effort that's going on with Commonwealth Fusion in Massachusetts, you're suddenly seeing that old idea—that fusion is great but infinitely far away—has gone away.”</p>
                    <p>The old idea has gone away because of achievements in computing, Kammen said yesterday at a virtual workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning.</p>
                    <p>“There are now people who are projecting small-trial fusion plants that couldn't have been done before without higher computing. We can't adjust the magnets, we can't do all kinds of things until we can do much better code. That is a transformative idea.”</p>
                    <p>Kammen was speaking in response to John Platt, head of the Applied Science branch of Google Research. Asked to describe his most- and least-impactful machine-learning projects, Platt had said both may be the same project.</p>
